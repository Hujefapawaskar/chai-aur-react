react fibre is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm that allows for incremental rendering of the virtual DOM. It breaks down the rendering work into smaller units, or "fibers," which can be processed over multiple frames. This approach improves performance and responsiveness, especially for complex applications with large component trees.
reconciliation is the process of comparing the current virtual DOM with a new virtual DOM to determine what has changed. React fibre enhances this process by allowing for interruptions and prioritization of updates, enabling smoother user experiences.
virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. It allows React to efficiently update the UI by minimizing direct manipulations of the DOM, which can be slow and costly in terms of performance. The virtual DOM is updated in memory, and React uses the reconciliation algorithm to determine the most efficient way to update the real DOM based on changes in the virtual DOM.
